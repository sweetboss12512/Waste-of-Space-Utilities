# Waste-of-Space-Libraries

Thingies I made for Waste of Space coding

## It's horribly inconsistent

- Some of the newer libraries (the ones not written in `snake_case`) are written with my forked verison of [autopilot.lua](https://github.com/flxwed/autopilot.lua),  forked version: [sweetboss12512/autopilot.lua](https://github.com/sweetboss12512/autopilot.lua/tree/stable)
so if you aren't using that, the type checker will yell at you :(
  
Whatever nobody will use these anywway
